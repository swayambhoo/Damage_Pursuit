##Damage Pursuit: A MATLAB package for automatic structural defect localization 

Damage pursuit is a Matlab-based software for detecting and triangulating material anomalies in physical
structures. The Damage pursuit package contains MATLAB GUI as well as command line interface. It works by decomposing the spatiotemporal displacement measurements of the structure, which are resulted from a propagating wave, into a spatially-smooth component associated with the undamaged bulkof the medium, and a spatially-localized component caused by existing anomalies. In order to perform the
decomposition, Damage Pursuit seeks efficient representations of the smooth and spatially-localized components
in terms of appropriate bases (also called dictionaries), which are chosen based on the overall behavior
of the respective component.
